A KDE multiplayer monopoly game with separate dedicated server daemon.

Old 90's hobby project that aimed to build a graphical monopoly game for the
then fairly new KDE desktop environment.

* kmonop: KDE GUI client: [client/](client/)
* monopd: headless server daemon: [server/](server/)

Never finished, but dug up from an old homedir archive.
